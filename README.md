This is a data journalism class' assignment. 
This is Sean Na, a 32-year-old Korean wanting to be an investigative reporter in future. He loves telling stories using numbers. However, he does not know how. One time, he found a data from the U.S. Department of Labor. The data exhibits wage violations compiled from 1975 to 2015 both in csv and excel files. Sean Na spent hours and hours squeezing his brain to streamline the data file. Apparently, he failed it. Many folks, or the readers, do care about the numbers. And it is a journalist's duty to analyze and interpret the numbers and turning them into a legible story. This is it. This is what Sean Na wants to learn from Mr. Chase Davis. My goodness. Sir, I am not-at-all a data savvy. But I am hoping that Sean Na would become, at least, novice data journalist after spending the next 13 weeks with you. Sir, thank you. And please enjoy your lunch in a great city New York.
